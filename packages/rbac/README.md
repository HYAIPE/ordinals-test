# ordinals-rbac

Code that has moved with me from project to project.

This module implements a simple roles based access control built on top of a single dynamodb table.

Various indexes are included for common lookup patterns.

Also included, for historical reasons, are the UsersNonce table which manages assigning nonces and other data to web3 users for authentication via message signatures.
